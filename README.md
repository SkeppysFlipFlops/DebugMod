                             INSTALLATION (STEAM, WINDOWS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Download the modding API from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_b9PFqx_PR9X1ZrWGFxUGdydTg
2) Right click Hollow Knight in Steam -> Properties -> Local Files -> Browse Local Files
3) Create a backup of the game files located here
4) Copy the contents of the modding API zip into this folder (Overwrite files when asked)
5) Copy the contents of this zip into the folder (Overwrite files when asked)
6) This mod should not affect saves negatively, but it is a good idea to back them up anyway.
   Saves are located at %AppData%\..\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight\
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     UPGRADING SAVE STATES TO SAVE STATES WITH PAGES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're upgrading DebugMod from version `1.4.7` or below, do the following:
1) Update the installed mod.
2) Start Hollow Knight and then exit.
3) Open a file browser and navigate to `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight`
4) Open DebugMod.GlobalSettings.json in a text editor
5) Modify MaxSaveStates's value from 6 to 10 if you want more save states per page of
   save states. Don't go higher than 10 - not exactly sure what'll happen but it 
   probably won't work as you want.
7) Save and close the file.
8) Back in the file browser, navigate to `Savestates Current Patch` - these are your 
   old save states
9) Move them to `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight\DebugModData\Savestates Current Patch\0`
   - this should make them visible to the updated mod on the first page of the save 
   states. The directory should be empty if you're upgrading from verion `1.4.7` 
   or below. You can delete `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Team Cherry\Hollow Knight\Savestates Current Patch`
   if you like.
10) Boot the game back up. You should be good to go!
11) Additionally, you probably want to bind the Next/Previous Page commands to make full
    use of the save state pages feature.
